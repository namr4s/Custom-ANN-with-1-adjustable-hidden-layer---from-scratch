# Custom ANN with 1 adjustable hidden layer from scratch

The dataset insuranceData.csv contains 2 attributes 'age' and 'affordability' to determine the whether the person has taken a insurance or not. (This is a binary classification problem)

Our Aim is to built a custom ANN with 1 hidden layer with adjustable no of neurons in it. The neurons in the hidden layers and output layer use ReLU and Sigmoid activation function respectively.
We use the binary cross entropy loss term to calculate the learning of ANN.
